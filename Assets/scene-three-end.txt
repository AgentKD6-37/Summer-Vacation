Everyone is completely out of breath by the time they make it to the safety of the woods bordering the Hay Field.

You look back and see the beam of the flashlight sweeping through the fields, searching in vain.

"What was he carrying to the barn?" Kory asks, "It kinda looked like a body in a bag right?"

No one wants to answer, so you sit in silence and think. Finally, you speak up.

"What if he's a spy? The documents with his old picture are from a different country, we found weird maps, obituaries,
maybe he is spying on us and has orders to pretend to be a farmer."

"I don't know..." Dewey looks a little scared by this suggestion.

Sara stops the speculation. "Guys, I found something in the briefcase that will help us figure it out."
She looks at you, "Meet me in Old Town tomorrow, I got a plan."
