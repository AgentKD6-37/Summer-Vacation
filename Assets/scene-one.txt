 At Paine Field you find an abandoned airplane in one of the old hangars. Inside is a dirty brown leather suitcase!


 You open the battered leather suitcase while your friends circle around to see.
 Inside, you find some yellowed paper documents with a young man’s face and some text you don’t recognize.
 The face looks eerily like Farmer Augustus Caldwell's younger self.
 The lettering looks like Russian but no one is sure.
 The sound of a car pulling up outside breaks the spell of the strange suitcase.
 You need to escape!

 The front door to the hangar is blocked off by the car and you can make out an open window in the back of the building.
 You search around for anything to help you climb out...
