Sneaking out of your house took time, and you are the last one to arrive at the field.

"Anything yet?" You ask Sara, who is perched on top of a hay bale with some Army surplus binoculars.
"No. He hasn't even-  Wait! There he is!"

You can barely make out the figure of an old man, dragging a large sack of *something* towards the barn.
As you watch him pull and stumble closer to the barn doors, Dewey gets the group's attention.

"Hey, I think I'm allergic to hay you guys..." Dewey makes a weird face, and, at the worst possible moment, sneezes!

"Who's out there!?" Farmer Augustus calls, pulling a flashlight from his over-alls and flashing it in your direction.
"Get out of my fields!"

If you don't do something fast, everyone will be caught!
