You finally find Sara in one of the downstairs room of the southern old house. She's crouched on the floor staring at
something. As you head over, she waves for you to hurry.

"Look at this," she says, pointing to an old map, "The old man has treasure."

Stretched between a broken doorknob, the edge of an old couch, a rock, and Sara's bag is a massive old map of the town.
You recognize some roads, but notice that where your houses are today was once farm land, and the new suburbs
that are being built now were once grazing area for cows. It seems the farm used to be much larger than it is today.
Sara is pointing to a spot on the river where it forks, leaving a small island between the east and west banks.
On the tip of the island, someone has drawn a blue 'X'.

"We need to get to the island and dig up his treasure. I bet it's valuable!" Sara says, looking excited.
"But first we need some supplies. Here's a list."

You look at the list:

1. Raft
2. Shovel
3. Food
4. Paddle

"When you find everything, come meet us at the river. We'll figure out the rest when we get this treasure!"
Sara packs up the map and runs off.

**New Task**
FIND SUPPLIES
GET TO THE RIVER
